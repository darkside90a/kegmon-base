# kegmon-base
A different solution of mp-se's Kegmon scale base

To make one base, I used:
* 7mm Plywood, 22cm dia
* 4x Feet, bottom: 309451-bot.stl
* 4x Feet, top: 309451-top2.stl
* 1x Lid over base connections: 309451-top3.stl
* Silicone Hose 5mm/6mm ID/OD
* 4x Stainless steel washer 5.3x20mm
* 2x Cable mounts
* 1x 40x60mm experiment PCB
* Foam tape
* UTP Cat6 cable
* Cable ties

The base feet are modified versions of Thingiverse thing #309451.
The top part is made thicker and has space for a larger OD washer.
The lid is a variant of the original top, just with more outlets.

The interconnection PCB under the center lid has been cut down to 40x40mm
with rounded corners, similar to outside dimensions of a bottom foot.
This way, the lid "clicks" in place over the PCB.

All parts are glued to the plywood base with strong foam tape.

3D printed parts were made out of ABS, 100% infill
